    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Fundraising</h1><br>
    <p>Fundraising is one of the main components of our club. We organize fundraisers so that club members can earn money to put towards the cost of their trips.</p><br>
    <p>Some of our past fundraisers include selling Krispy Kreme donuts during tailgating before a Michigan Football game, selling Chick-Fil-A in the Dude on North Campus, doing a Halloween and St. Patty's Day Balloon-Pop fundraiser outside Charley's where people can pop balloons and win a prize, and selling food during Hash Bash!</p><br>

    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Philanthropy</h1><br>
    <p>Giving back to the community around our campus is also an important part of our club. We participate in philanthropy events surrounding the topics of sustainability, education, and wildlife conservation.</p><br>
    <p>Past philanthropy events include volunteering at the Creature Conservancy, participating in a recycling event at the Ann Arbor ReUse Center, educating an elementary class about being global citizens, and volunteering at a Food Gatherers.</p><br>

  <div class="box">
    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Outreach</h1><br>
    <p>Beyond philanthropy events, we also like to put on Outreach events and programs in order to bring awareness to relevant topics within our campus community.</p>
    <p>We've done movie screenings about Coral Reef Conservation, tabling for Plastic Awareness Week, and learned about refugees with MRAP.</p><br>

  <div class="box">
    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Social</h1><br>
    <p>We love having social events so that we can get to know our fellow Michigan GIVErs! We're more than just club members, we've created lifelong friendships through our shared interests.</p><br>
    <p>Each year we hold a GIVE alumni dinner, we've held a game night, cooked authentic food from a global country, and even went on a trip to the Smokey Mountains!</p><br>
